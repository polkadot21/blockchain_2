# Practical tasks in Blockchain 2

This repository contains a few tasks provided by the Prof. Oettler as part of the master programme's curriculum in Blockchain & DLT at the Mittweida University of Applied science.

The original task sheet was composed to be implemented in JavaScript. However, I don't really recognize JS as a programming language to the reasons listed here (https://github.com/denysdovhan/wtfjs).

But jokes aside, I just wanted to get my hands dirty with rust yet again.

## Installation & Usage
